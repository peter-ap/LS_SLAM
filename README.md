# LS_SLAM
This is an attempt at a comprehensive Python3 graph-based SLAM algorithm using landmarks (Work in Progress)


Standard run inmports a .mat file with the necessary data (poses, landmarks, edges/measurments with information matrices)
-> the import is a little bit messy but it works. 

Working on corner detection + association for using laser scanner and encoder data to sucessfully determine the robot's path.
